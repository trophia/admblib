# `admblib` : A micro-library of functions and macros for use with ADMB

This is a modest little library of functions and macros that are useful when using ADMB. It is mainly for my own use and reflects my personal tastes in coding style and ADMB usage patterns. 

Don't expect well documented code. If others find this useful, and there is some demand, then that may change.

Some of the function here are implemented elsewhere (e.g statlib that comes with ADMB) but they may be reimplemented here to math naming and/or calling conventions.
