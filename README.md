# `admblib` : A utlity library for use with ADMB

This is a modest little library of classes, functions and macros for use with [ADMB)](http://admb-project.org/).

`admblib` uses featues of the [C++11 standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++11) like the oh-so-convienient-why-couldn't-we-have-had-this-ten-years-ago [type inference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++11#Type_inference) and the mind-bending-but-uber-useful [variadic templates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_templates). So, to use it you'll need a modern compiler that supports those features. `admblib` has been develped using `gcc 4.8.1`.

Beware, although small, `admblib` is unsociable, intoverted and perhaps even misanthropic.
It exists mainly for the author's own use and reflects his personal tastes in C++ coding style and ADMB usage patterns. 
Don't expect well documented code or a comprehensive set of functions in a particular domain.
`admblib` is likely to have irregular and adhoc development.
Despite these failings, other people might just find bits of `admblib` useful, so that is why it is here.
If you use it, [let me know](mailto:nokome.bentley@trophia.com?subject=admblib...&body=...is%20a%20complete%20waste%20of%20time%20%2F%20quite%20useful%20(delete%20as%20appropriate)), and I might be able to make `admblib` a little less reticent.
